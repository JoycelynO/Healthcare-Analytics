# Healthcare-Analytics

In this project, I play the role of a healthcare data analyst that guides strategic decisions at a local hospital. The hospital's management team expressed concerns about resource allocation and patient care efficiency across different departments. 
My goal was to provide actionable insights into patients' demographics, diagnosis, and visit patterns to optimize service delivery and enhance patient outcomes.
